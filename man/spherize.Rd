\title{Spherize data.}
\usage{
spherize(population, variables, sample, regularization_param = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{population}{tbl with grouping (metadata) and observation variables.}

\item{variables}{character vector specifying observation variables.}

\item{sample}{tbl containing sample that is used by the method to estimate
sphering parameters. \code{sample} has same structure as \code{population}.
Typically, \code{sample} corresponds to controls in the experiment.}

\item{regularization_param}{optional parameter used in sphering to offset
eigenvalues to avoid division by zero.}
}
\value{
transformed data of the same class as \code{population}.
}
\description{
\code{spherize} transforms specified observation variables by estimating a
sphering transformation on a sample and applying it to the population.
}
\examples{
population <- tibble::tibble(
  Metadata_Well = c("A01", "A02", "B01", "B02"),
  Intensity_DNA = c(8, 20, 12, 32),
  Texture_DNA = c(5, 2, 43, 13)
)
variables <- c("Intensity_DNA", "Texture_DNA")
spherize(population, variables, population, 0.01)
